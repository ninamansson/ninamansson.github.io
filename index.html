			<p> Today I work as a test organizer and test leader and as a technical writer at Infomaker. I have also the role as s a support coordinator.<br> In my spare time I love to go the fitness-center and to be outdoor with my family. I have a great interest in questions and concerns about our environment. Are you interested in a discussion about how to take care of our Planet Earth? I try to live as a  responible planet steward and I love to discuss what that means to me. </p>
